/**
 * Empty a vendored tree in place, ready for a tarball to be extracted over it.
 *
 * The obvious `rmSync(dest, {recursive:true})` cannot be used here: a file-
 * syncing agent (Dropbox, on the machine this is developed on) holds directory
 * handles open, and the final rmdir fails with EPERM even after every child is
 * gone — leaving the tree half-gutted and the run dead, which then needs a git
 * restore before anything can load again.
 *
 * vendor-update.sh already avoided rmdir'ing the TOP directory for that reason.
 * The gap was one level down: removing a child directory recursively still ends
 * in an rmdir of that child, and a lock on lib/ kills the run just as well as a
 * lock on the root.
 *
 * So: try the clean removal for each entry, and where a directory refuses,
 * fall back to deleting its files and leaving the (empty) directory behind. The
 * extract repopulates it. An empty directory upstream no longer ships is the
 * only residue, and it carries no code.
 *
